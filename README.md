#### How to run express server
In your command line tool (CLI) type `cd` or go into the backend folder. Type the command npm app to start the server. If successful, you should see: **"localhost server started on 3004"** on your terminal. And once the app connects with Mongodb on Mlab, you should see: **"Mongodb now connected"**. Press `Ctrl C` to exit.
