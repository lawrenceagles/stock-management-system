#### How to run express server
In your command line tool (CLI), after you clone the repository or pull. Type `cd backend` or go into the backend folder manually. Type the command node app to start the server. If successful, you should see: **"localhost server started on 3004"** on your terminal. And once the app connects with Mongodb locally or on Mlab, you should see: **"Mongodb now connected"**. To exit press `Ctrl C`.
